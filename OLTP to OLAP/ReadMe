This project was a semester long step-by-step conversion of an Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) Database into an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) DataWarehouse using SSIS/SSAS and a bit of SSRS to answer business queries on this data.

Within the folder is the final project which was built upon 3 previous assignments which were:
1) building the initial OLTP DB using MS SQL Server.
2) extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) the OLTP DB and creating the OLAP DW using SSIS in Visual Studio. And a little bit of reporting using SSRS.
3) using SSAS, again in Visual Studio to define the dimensions of the data, create intermediate measurements, Key Performance Indicators (KPI)

The fourth, and final assignment was to do all the previous works for a new DB & DW and to do answer business questions which defined the necessary data, measurements, and KPIs needed. 
The only given materials was a schema for the OLTP DB, which needed to be created properly for full credit.
Unneeded data or measurements in the final report were penalized, so the project made my partner and I map out what needed to be taken from the OLTP DB, how we needed to transform the data, and what dimensions and measurements were needed to fulfill the requirements.

I really enjoyed this project, it was very satisfying to see everything run properly. Its the same warm feeling of watching a long program in Java or C# compile without error, and produce the result(s) you expected.
