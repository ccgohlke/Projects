This paper is the culmination of months of research by a team of 4, though the primary objective of this paper for me was to lead a diverse team successfully without using a heavy handed approach.

Our team consisted of students from the Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Marketing, and Management degree paths.
I do find it humorous that as the CIS student I still ended up managing the team, guess my age intimidated the MGMT student, lol.

In the past I've lead teams very harshly, which I felt it resulted in subpar work that I would need to clean up afterwards. 
So for this project I proposed that we had weekly check-ins and progress reports. Even if it was one line saying "Nothing new this week, had tests." was fine, I felt that keeping the team engaged on a long term project would save us for crunching the last week.

Additionally any deadlines for the paper were considered to be due to the team 2 weeks in advance for review and editting. This worked really well, since when the inevitable section was turned in a few days "late" to the team, it was still done long before the class due date. Allowing for corrections, and editting in a timely fashion.
